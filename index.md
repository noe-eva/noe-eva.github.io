### Grüezi!

I'm Noëmi Aepli, a Swiss PhD student in the field of Natural Language Processing. Currently I'm based in Zurich, at the [Institute of Computational Linguistics](www.cl.uzh.ch) at the University of Zurich.

I've been passionate about Swiss German Natural Language Processing since 2012 when I started a project with a fellow student: [NOAH's Corpus: Swiss German Part-of-Speech Tagging](https://noe-eva.github.io/NOAH-Corpus/) and have been involved in many Swiss German NLP projects since. Furthermore, I wrote my Master's Thesis in the field: ["Parsing Approaches for Swiss German"](https://noe-eva.github.io/SwissGermanUD/) ([PDF](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:cdad4255-ddd4-4071-a706-491e75085339/aepli_noemi_1990.pdf)) and started the process of adding my manually created parse trees to the [Universal Dependency Treebanks](https://universaldependencies.org/).

### Research Interests

- [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
- NLP for low-resource languages & language varieties
- Multimodal approaches; combining phonetic/audio information and text

### Publications

A list of my publications is [here](/Publications/) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=ZMIlpKUAAAAJ&hl=de). The [PDFs](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/naepli.html) can all be downloaded from ZORA (Zurich Open Repository Archive).
