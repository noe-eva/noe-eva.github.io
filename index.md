### Grüezi!

I'm Noëmi Aepli, a Swiss PhD student in the field of Computational Linguistics and Language Technology.

I've been passionate about Swiss German Natural Language Processing since 2012 when I started a project with a fellow student Nora Hollenstein. [NOAH's Corpus: Swiss German Part-of-Speech Tagging](https://noe-eva.github.io/NOAH-Corpus/) I've been involved in many Swiss German NLP projects since like e.g. the [ArchiMob Corpus](https://www.spur.uzh.ch/en/departments/research/textgroup/ArchiMob.html) and wrote my Master's Thesis in the field: ["Parsing Approaches for Swiss German"](https://noe-eva.github.io/SwissGermanUD/) ([PDF](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:cdad4255-ddd4-4071-a706-491e75085339/aepli_noemi_1990.pdf)).
