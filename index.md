### Grüezi!

I'm Noëmi Aepli, a Swiss PhD student in the field of Computational Linguistics and Language Technology.

My PhD project about [Sentiment Inference](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html) is funded by the [Swiss National Foundation (SNF)](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) from December 2018 to December 2022. I work at the [Institute of Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html) of the [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html) under the supervision of [Manfred Klenner](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html) and [Martin Volk](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/volk.html).

I've been passionate about Swiss German Natural Language Processing since 2012 when I started a project with a fellow student Nora Hollenstein. [NOAH's Corpus: Swiss German Part-of-Speech Tagging](https://noe-eva.github.io/NOAH-Corpus/) I've been involved in many Swiss German NLP projects since like e.g. the [ArchiMob Corpus](https://www.spur.uzh.ch/en/departments/research/textgroup/ArchiMob.html) and wrote my Master's Thesis in the field: ["Parsing Approaches for Swiss German"](https://noe-eva.github.io/SwissGermanUD/) ([PDF](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:cdad4255-ddd4-4071-a706-491e75085339/aepli_noemi_1990.pdf)).
