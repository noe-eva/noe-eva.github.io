I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research is driven by a deep fascination with dialects, language variation, and the unique challenges they pose for natural language processing (NLP). 
I earned my PhD in Computational Linguistics and Language Technology from the University of Zurich in Switzerland.
