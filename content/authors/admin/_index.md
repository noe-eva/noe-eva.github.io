I'm a Swiss PhD student in the field of Natural Language Processing. Currently I'm based in Zurich, at the Institute of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich.

I've been passionate about Swiss German Natural Language Processing since 2012 when I started a project with a fellow student: NOAH's Corpus: Swiss German Part-of-Speech Tagging and have been involved in many Swiss German NLP projects since. Furthermore, I wrote my Master's Thesis in the field: "Parsing Approaches for Swiss German" (PDF). Since November 2019, my manually created parse trees are part of the Universal Dependency Treebanks version 2.5: UD_Swiss_German-UZH.
